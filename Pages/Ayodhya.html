            <p class="info">
              Ayodhya is a city located in Uttar Pradesh, India, that holds significant religious and cultural importance for both Hindus and Muslims. It is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama, a Hindu deity, and was the site of the Babri Mosque before its demolition in 1992. The conflict over the ownership of the site has been a source of tension between the two communities for decades, and the Supreme Court of India ruled in November 2019 that the land should be given to a trust to build a Hindu temple. Despite its controversial history, Ayodhya remains an important pilgrimage destination and attracts thousands of visitors every year. There are several transportation options available to reach Ayodhya, including air, train, bus, and car. The best time to visit Ayodhya depends on the purpose of the visit, but it is advisable to avoid peak tourist season.

          <p class="info">
            The best time to visit Ayodhya for religious pilgrims is during festivals such as Ram Navami. For history and culture enthusiasts, the months of October to March offer pleasant weather for sightseeing. It is busy year-round, with larger crowds during festivals and holidays, so off-season visits may be preferable for a more peaceful trip.
