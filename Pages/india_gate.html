              India Gate is a war memorial in New Delhi, built to commemorate the Indian soldiers who died in World War I and the Afghan Wars. Designed by Edwin Lutyens and completed in 1931, it is a 42-meter-high archway made of red and yellow sandstone. The names of more than 13,500 servicemen who died are inscribed on the walls, and two pavilions house the eternal flame. The monument is surrounded by gardens and fountains, which are especially beautiful when lit up in the evenings. India Gate is a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of India's rich history and culture. Nearby landmarks include the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Parliament House, and the nearby Rajpath road is a popular place for parades and national celebrations.
