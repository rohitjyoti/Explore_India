              Taj Mahal (initially named Rauza-i-Munavvara, 'the Illumined
              Tomb') is one of the most iconic contributions to the landscape of
              architecture by the Mughals. Its construction was commissioned by
              Shah Jahan in 1632 as the burial site for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
              The Taj Mahal was built on land bought from a high-ranking noble.
              It is situated next to the river Jamuna in the city of Agra,
              India. The responsibility of planning and building the monument
              was given to the architects, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri and Mir Abdul
              Karim with Makramat Khan as the administrator. Across the world,
              the Taj Mahal is understood to be symbolic of undying love. Prince
              Khurram (the future Shah Jahan) succeeded his father, Jahangir as
              the Emperor.

          <p class="info">
            Like many parts of Northern India, the best time of year to visit
            Agra is between October and February, avoiding the scorching heat of
            summer and the monsoon rains. Regardless of the time of year, make
            sure your trip to Agra doesn't fall on a Friday when the Taj Mahal
            is closed for religious reasons.

            <b>By Bus:</b> <br />
            If you're looking for the cheapest way to get from Delhi to Agra,
            the bus is your best option. The company RedBus shows you
            itineraries for all of the different bus companies and lets you
            purchase tickets directly from their website.
          </p>
          <p class="info">
            <b>By Car:</b> <br />
            Driving your own vehicle from Delhi to Agra is only for those with
            ample experience driving in India. If you aren't familiar with
            India's driving laws—or drivers' tendencies to disregard those
            laws—then driving your own vehicle is the most stressful and unsafe
            option for travel. However, if the train or bus is too much of a
            hassle, hiring a private car or taxi is the easiest option for
            getting to the Taj Mahal.
          </p>
          <p class="info">
            <b>By Train:</b> <br />
            The most popular way of getting from Delhi to Agra is by train. It's
            possible to visit the Taj Mahal in a day from Delhi if you catch the
            right trains, the fastest of which get you from city to city in two
            hours.
